1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
A) DriverPass was a company who provided DMV test practice services. They provided driver training and practice tests to clients based on different packages. They wanted us to build a webservice for people to access scheduling for the driver training and their practice tests.

2) What did you do particularly well?
A) I did a good job with the business requirement document. I was able to break down all of the different requirements into easy to understand bullet points. This made creating different diagrams easier.

3) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A) I would make my case diagram easier to read. My arrows are a little cluttered which can make it difficult for people to read it. I would of used straight lines leading from the actors so that you can easier see what they are interacting with.

4)How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A) The users wanted easy access to the many different options they had. I made sure that they had access to every part of their account and could choose the different packages they wanted. Many users will stop using a product if it is overly complicated and hard to understand. This is why it is important to listen to their wants and adjust what you can to better suit their needs.

5)How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
A) I like to handle each part of the software development individually. You need each piece working on its own before you can add it to the system as a whole. I would break everything down as small as possible so I can work on each part one at a time.
